title: Deploying Zero
---

To deploy a Zero app, you need to:

1. Deploy your backend database. Most standard Postgres hosts [work with Zero](connecting-to-postgres).
1. Deploy `zero-cache`. We provide a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocicorp/zero) that can work with most Docker hosts.
1. Deploy your frontend. You can use any hosting service like Vercel or Netlify.

This page described how to deploy `zero-cache`.

## Architecture

`zero-cache` is a horizontally scalable, stateful web service that maintains a SQLite replica of your Postgres database. It uses this replica to sync ZQL queries to clients over WebSockets.

You don't have to know the details of how `zero-cache` works to run it, but it helps to know the basic structure.

<ImageLightbox src="/images/deployment/arch.png" alt="Network Architecture" />

A running `zero-cache` is composed of a single `replication-manager` node and multiple `view-syncer` nodes. It also depends on Postgres, S3, and attached SSD storage.

**Upstream:** Your application's Postgres database.

**Change DB:** A Postgres DB used by Zero to store a recent subset of the Postgres replication log.

**CVR DB:** A Postgres DB used by Zero to store Client View Records (CVRs). CVRs track the state of each synced client.

<Note type="note">
The Change DB and CVR DBs can be the same physical Postgres database as the Upstream DB. Zero stores their tables in separate Postgres schemas so they won't conflict with your application data.

We allow separate DBs so that they can be scaled and tuned independently if desired.
</Note>

**S3:** Stores a canonical copy of the SQLite replica.

**File System:** Used by both node types to store local copies of the SQLite replica. Can be ephemeral – Zero will re-initialize from S3 on startup. Recommended to use attached SSD storage for best performance.

**Replication Manager:** Serves as the single consumer of the Postgres replication log. Stores a recent subset of the Postgres changelog in the *Change DB* for catching up ViewSyncers when they initialize. Also maintains the canonical replica, which ViewSyncers initialize from.

**View Syncers:** Handle WebSocket connections from clients and run ZQL queries. Updates CVR DB with the latest state of each client as queries run. Uses CVR DB on client connection to compute the initial diff to catch clients up.

## Topology

You should deploy `zero-cache` close to your database because the mutation implementation is chatty.

In the future, mutations will [move out of `zero-cache`](https://bugs.rocicorp.dev/issue/3045#comment-5a3BKxP8RfJ9njHLgx5e3).
When that happens you can deploy `zero-cache` geographically distributed and it will double as a read-replica.

## Updating

When run with multiple View Syncer nodes, `zero-cache` supports rolling, downtime-free updates. A new Replication Manager takes over the replication stream from the old Replication Manager, and connections from the old View Syncers are gradually drained and absorbed by active View Syncers.

## Configuration

The `zero-cache` image is configured via environment variables. See [zero-cache Config](./zero-cache-config) for available options.

## Guide: Multi-Node on SST+AWS

[SST](https://sst.dev/) is our recommended way to deploy Zero.

### Setup Upstream

Create an upstream Postgres database server somewhere. See [Connecting to Postgres](connecting-to-postgres) for details. Ensure the upstream, change, and cvr databases are created.

### Setup AWS

See [AWS setup guide](https://v2.sst.dev/setting-up-aws). The end result should be that you have a dev profile and SSO session defined in your `~/.aws/config` file.

### Initialize SST

```bash
npx sst init --yes
```

Choose "aws" for where to deploy.

Then overwite `/sst.config.ts` with the following code:

```ts
/* eslint-disable */
/// <reference path="./.sst/platform/config.d.ts" />
import { readFileSync } from "fs";

export default $config({
  app(input) {
    return {
      name: "hello-zero",
      removal: input?.stage === "production" ? "retain" : "remove",
      home: "aws",
      region: process.env.AWS_REGION || "us-east-1",
    };
  },
  async run() {
    const loadSchemaJson = () => {
      if (process.env.ZERO_SCHEMA_JSON) {
        return process.env.ZERO_SCHEMA_JSON;
      }

      try {
        const schema = readFileSync("zero-schema.json", "utf8");
        // Parse and stringify to ensure single line
        return JSON.stringify(JSON.parse(schema));
      } catch (error) {
        const e = error as Error;
        console.error(`Failed to read schema file: ${e.message}`);
        throw new Error(
          "Schema must be provided via ZERO_SCHEMA_JSON env var or zero-schema.json file"
        );
      }
    };

    const schemaJson = loadSchemaJson();

    // S3 Bucket
    const replicationBucket = new sst.aws.Bucket(`replication-bucket`);

    // VPC Configuration
    const vpc = new sst.aws.Vpc(`vpc`, {
      az: 2,
    });

    // ECS Cluster
    const cluster = new sst.aws.Cluster(`cluster`, {
      vpc,
    });

    const conn = new sst.Secret("PostgresConnectionString");
    const zeroAuthSecret = new sst.Secret("ZeroAuthSecret");

    // Common environment variables
    const commonEnv = {
      ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB: conn.value,
      ZERO_CVR_DB: conn.value,
      ZERO_CHANGE_DB: conn.value,
      ZERO_SCHEMA_JSON: schemaJson,
      ZERO_AUTH_SECRET: zeroAuthSecret.value,

    };

    // Replication Manager Service
    const replicationManager = cluster.addService(`replication-manager`, {
      cpu: "2 vCPU",
      memory: "8 GB",
      image: commonEnv.ZERO_IMAGE_URL,
      link: [replicationBucket],
      health: {

          {
            listen: "80/http",
            forward: "4849/http",
          },
        ],
      },
      transform: {
        loadBalancer: {
          idleTimeout: 3600,
        },
        target: {

            interval: 5,
            healthyThreshold: 2,
            timeout: 3,
          },
        },
      },
    });

    // View Syncer Service
    cluster.addService(`view-syncer`, {
      cpu: "2 vCPU",
      memory: "8 GB",
      image: commonEnv.ZERO_IMAGE_URL,
      link: [replicationBucket],

            interval: 5,
            healthyThreshold: 2,
            timeout: 3,
          },
          stickiness: {
            enabled: true,
            type: "lb_cookie",
            cookieDuration: 120,
          },
          loadBalancingAlgorithmType: "least_outstanding_requests",
        },
      },
    });
  },
});
```

### Set SST Secrets

Configure SST with your Postgres connection string and [Zero Auth Secret](/docs/auth#server).

Note that if you use JWT-based auth, you'll need to change the environment variables in the `sst.config.ts` file above, then set a different secret here.

```bash
npx sst secret set PostgresConnectionString "YOUR-PG-CONN-STRING"
npx sst secret set ZeroAuthSecret "YOUR-ZERO-AUTH-SECRET"
```

### Deploy

```bash
npx sst deploy
```

This takes about 5-10 minutes.

If successful, you should see a URL for the `view-syncer` service. This is the URL to pass to the `server` parameter of the `Zero` constructor on the client.

## Guide: Single-Node on Fly.io

Let's deploy the [Quickstart](quickstart) app to [Fly.io](https://fly.io). We'll use Fly.io for both the database and `zero-cache`.

### Setup Quickstart

Go through the [Quickstart](quickstart) guide to get the app running locally.

### Setup Fly.io

Create an account on [Fly.io](https://fly.io) and [install the Fly CLI](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/install/).

### Create Postgres app

<Note type="warning">
  **Note:** Fly.io requires app names to be unique across all Fly.io users.
  Change the `INITIALS` environment variable below to something unique.
</Note>

```bash
INITIALS=aa
PG_APP_NAME=$INITIALS-zstart-pg

PG_PASSWORD="$(head -c 256 /dev/urandom | od -An -t x1 | tr -d ' \n' | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z' | head -c 16)"

fly postgres create \
  --name $PG_APP_NAME \
  --region lax \
  --initial-cluster-size 1 \
  --vm-size shared-cpu-2x \
  --volume-size 40 \
  --password=$PG_PASSWORD
```

### Seed Upstream database

Populate the database with initial data and set its `wal_level` to `logical` to support replication to `zero-cache`. Then restart the database to apply the changes.

```bash
(cat ./docker/seed.sql; echo "\q") | fly pg connect -a $PG_APP_NAME
echo "ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = logical; \q" | fly pg connect -a $PG_APP_NAME
fly postgres restart --app $PG_APP_NAME
```

### Create `zero-cache` Fly.io app

```bash
CACHE_APP_NAME=$INITIALS-zstart-cache
fly app create $CACHE_APP_NAME
```

### Publish `zero-cache`

Create a `fly.toml` file. We'll copy the `zero-schema.json` into the toml file to pass it to the server as an environment variable.

```bash
CONNECTION_STRING="postgres://postgres:$PG_PASSWORD@$PG_APP_NAME.flycast:5432"

cat <<EOF > fly.toml
app = "$CACHE_APP_NAME"
primary_region = 'lax'

[build]
image = "registry.hub.docker.com/rocicorp/zero:latest"

[http_service]
internal_port = 4848
force_https = true
auto_stop_machines = 'off'
min_machines_running = 1

[[http_service.checks]]
grace_period = "10s"
interval = "30s"
method = "GET"
timeout = "5s"
path = "/"

[[vm]]
memory = '2gb'
cpu_kind = 'shared'
cpus = 2

[mounts]
source = "sqlite_db"
destination = "/data"

[env]
ZERO_REPLICA_FILE = "/data/sync-replica.db"
ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB="${CONNECTION_STRING}/zstart?sslmode=disable"
ZERO_CVR_DB="${CONNECTION_STRING}/zstart_cvr?sslmode=disable"
ZERO_CHANGE_DB="${CONNECTION_STRING}/zstart_cdb?sslmode=disable"
ZERO_AUTH_SECRET="secretkey"
LOG_LEVEL = "debug"
ZERO_SCHEMA_JSON = """$(cat zero-schema.json)"""
EOF
```

Then publish `zero-cache`:

```bash
fly deploy
```

### Use Remote `zero-cache`

```bash
cat <<EOF > .env
VITE_PUBLIC_SERVER='https://${CACHE_APP_NAME}.fly.dev/'
EOF
```

Now restart the frontend to pick up the env change, and refresh the app. You can stop your local database and `zero-cache` as we're not using them anymore. Open the web inspector to verify the app is talking to the remote `zero-cache`!

You can deploy the frontend to any standard hosting service like Vercel or Netlify, or even to Fly.io!

### Deploy Frontend to Vercel

If you've followed the above guide and deployed `zero-cache` to fly, you can simply run:

```sh
vercel deploy --prod \
  -e ZERO_AUTH_SECRET="secretkey" \
  -e VITE_PUBLIC_SERVER='https://${CACHE_APP_NAME}.fly.dev/'
```

to deploy your frontend to Vercel.

Explaining the arguments above --

- `ZERO_AUTH_SECRET` - The secret to create and verify JWTs. This is the same secret that was used when deploying zero-cache to fly.
- `VITE_PUBLIC_SERVER` - The URL the frontend will call to talk to the zero-cache server. This is the URL of the fly app.

## Guide: Multi-Node on Raw AWS

### S3 Bucket

Create an S3 bucket. `zero-cache` uses S3 to backup its SQLite replica so that it survives task restarts.

### Fargate Services

Run `zero-cache` as two Fargate services (using the same [rocicorp/zero](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocicorp/zero) docker image):

#### replication-manager

- `zero-cache` [config](https://zero.rocicorp.dev/docs/zero-cache-config):
  - `ZERO_LITESTREAM_BACKUP_URL=s3://{bucketName}/{generation}`
  - `ZERO_NUM_SYNC_WORKERS=0`
- Task count: **1**

#### view-syncer

- `zero-cache` config:
  - `ZERO_LITESTREAM_BACKUP_URL=s3://{bucketName}/{generation}`
  - `ZERO_CHANGE_STREAMER_URI=http://{replication-manager}`
- Task count: **N**
- Loadbalancing to port **4848** with
  - algorithm: `least_outstanding_requests`
  - health check interval: 5 seconds
  - stickiness: `lb_cookie`
  - stickiness duration: 3 minutes

### Notes

- Standard rolling restarts are fine for both services
- The `view-syncer` task count is static; update the service to change the count.
  - Support for dynamic resizing (i.e. Auto Scaling) is planned
  - Set `ZERO_CVR_MAX_CONNS` and `ZERO_UPSTREAM_MAX_CONNS` appropriately so that the total connections from both running and updating `view-syncers` (e.g. DesiredCount * MaximumPercent) do not exceed your database’s `max_connections`.
- The `{generation}` component of the `s3://{bucketName}/{generation}` URL is an arbitrary path component that can be modified to reset the replica (e.g. a date, a number, etc.). Setting this to a new path is the multi-node equivalent of deleting the replica file to resync.
  - Note: `zero-cache` does not manage cleanup of old generations.
- The `replication-manager` serves requests on port **4849**. Routing from the `view-syncer` to the `http://{replication-manager}` can be achieved using the following mechanisms (in order of preference):
  - An internal load balancer
  - [Service Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-connect.html)
  - [Service Discovery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-discovery.html)
- Fargate ephemeral storage is used for the replica.
  - The default size is 20GB. This can be increased up to 200GB
  - Allocate at least twice the size of the database to support the internal VACUUM operation.
