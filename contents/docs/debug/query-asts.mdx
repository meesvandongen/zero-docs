title: Query ASTs
---

When inspecting websocket messages going between client and server you may and up with some query ASTs on your hands. These are hard to read but there is a utility to reverse the AST back to a ZQL query.

Save the AST to a json file. Then run the following command:

```bash
cat ast.json | npx ast-to-zql
```

The returned ZQL query will be using server names, rather than client names, to identify columns and tables.
If you provide the schema file as an option you will get mapped back to client names:

```bash
cat ast.json | npx ast-to-zql --schema schema.ts
```

This comes into play if, in your schema.ts, you use the `from` feature to have different names on the client than your backend DB.

<Note type="note">
  The ast-to-zql process is a de-compilation of sorts. Given that, the ZQL
  string you get back will not be identical to the one you wrote in your
  application. Regardless, the queries will be semantically equivalent.
